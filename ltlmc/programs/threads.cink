/* This is a very simple example with threads.
   This program is not meant to be executed, it is meant to be model checked.
   The model-checker can be called either using the "krun" command:

   krun programs/threads.cink  --ltlmc "<>Ltl gt(r, 1)"

   If the formula is stored into a file, say form-threads.cink, then the following 
   command can be used:

   krun programs/peterson.cink --ltlmc programs/form-threads.cink 

   Recall that the definition must be parsed with the command

   kompile cink --transition="kripke"
