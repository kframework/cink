/*@ \section{Syntax}
The syntax of \Cink is written using the last version at the moment of the 
\KTool. Since the language is relatively small, we use the facilities the 
\KTool offers for defining the syntax.This is given using a BNF-like 
notation enriched with annotations and priority specifications.
In this way, the rules giving semantics are written using the \Cink 
syntax.
