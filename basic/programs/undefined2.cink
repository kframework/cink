/*

This example includes a program with undefined behavior.
This can be exhibited by showing the non-deterministic behavior of the program.

 -- The compiling command

     	kompile cink --superheat="plus"

 -- The execution command 

	krun programs/undefined2.cink --search



The undefinedness is exhibited by the two solutions reported.
