/*

This example includes a program with a non-defined behavior.
This can be exhibited by showing the non-deterministic behavior of the program.

 -- The compiling command

     	kompile cink --superheat="plus" --supercool="mem-lookup mem-update"

 -- The execution command 

	krun programs/sum.cink --search

Three solutions should be reported.
